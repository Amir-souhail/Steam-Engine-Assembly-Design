### Steam Engine Assembly Design

This repository contains the 3D model and detailed 2D drawing files for a steam engine assembly, created using **SolidWorks**. The design is inspired by classic steam engine mechanisms and is intended for educational purposes and modeling practice.

---

#### Features
- **SolidWorks Files**: Includes both 3D part and assembly files, along with 2D technical drawings.
- **Detailed 2D Drawings**: Fully dimensioned 2D files allow users to recreate the 3D models in SolidWorks or any compatible CAD software.
- **Inspired Design**: This assembly is modeled based on classic steam engine designs, combining functionality with ease of understanding.
- **Educational Focus**: Ideal for learners and professionals to practice converting 2D drawings into 3D models.

#### How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the provided 2D or 3D files in **SolidWorks**.
3. Use the 2D drawings to recreate the 3D models step by step if desired.
4. Assemble the components to form the final steam engine model.
